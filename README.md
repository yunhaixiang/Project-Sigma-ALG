# Project Sigma: Algebraic Geometry

This repository is a part of Project Sigma focused on Algebraic Geometry. Project Sigma is a collection of my personal course notes on various mathematical topics, titled _The Egregium_. Visit [Project Sigma](https://thesingularity.me/archives/2b4d8af0/) to read more. 

The main text I use is _THE RISING SEA: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry_ by Ravi Vakil, which can be downloaded for free online.
